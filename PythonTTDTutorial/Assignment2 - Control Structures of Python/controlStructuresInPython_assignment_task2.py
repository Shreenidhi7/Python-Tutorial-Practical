Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop

Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
1.   Uses a for loop to iterate over numbers from 1 to 50.
2.   Calculates the sum of all integers in this range.
3.   Displays the final sum.

Expected Output:
The program should return:
- The sum of numbers from 1 to 50 is : 1275
"""

sumOfNumbers = 0

for i in range(1,51,1):
    sumOfNumbers = sumOfNumbers + i
    print(f"Adding the value {i} to the existing total/sum :: {sumOfNumbers}")
print(f"The sum of numbers from 1 to 50 is: {sumOfNumbers}")
